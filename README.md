# CTFTime Stats Tracker

Query CTFTime at an interval and store data in a database only when there is a change in the data. Hit webhook whenever there is a change to the data so applications can update their data.

This is a custom application made for MQCybersec.

The [MQCybersec bot](https://github.com/Solopie/mqcybersec-bot) will listen to webhooks hit by this script to update the information on the MQCybersec server.
